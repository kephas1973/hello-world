# hello-world
Learning to use GitHub for the first time.

My name is Robert Rose and I am a novice java programmer.
I am learning in this class as I go along.
Concepts that I learned in college courses are becoming apparently clear.
I hope to succeed in my training session and to learn as much as I can!

My goal for now is to step through the GitHub tutorial.
